    <h2>Favicon</h2>
    <p>A favicon is a small icon associated with a website that appears in the browser tab, bookmark bar, and other areas of the browser interface. It stands for "favorite icon" and is typically a square image, usually 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels in size, though higher resolutions like 64x64 pixels are also common for better clarity on high-resolution screens. It help users quickly identify and distinguish between different websites when multiple tabs are open in a web browser.
